Halley has been observed for centuries by different astronomers, but it was not until 1705 that Edmond Halley discovered that the observations corresponded to the same comet.
During its appearance in 1986, Halley's comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by a spacecraft. 
This comet can be observed with the naked eye from Earth every 76 years, due to its orbit. 
The last time it was observed was in 1986 and the next appearance will be in 2061.

In our model we will simulate a change in Halley's orbit, modeling what would happen if the comet passes closer to Earth on its next appearance.
