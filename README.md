## Introduction: 
>- #### What is a comet?
Comets are remnants from the beginning of the solar system, about 4.6 billion years ago. They are balls of rock and ice that form tails as they approach the sun during their perfect elliptical orbits. When comets heat up, they eject gas and dust, forming a trail behind them. The sun illuminates this trail, making it glow.

Each comet has a small frozen part called a nucleus. The nucleus contains chunks of ice and frozen gases with bits of rocks and dust embedded in them. The nucleus may have a small rocky interior.

>- #### Halley comet
Halley is a short-period comet with origin in the so-called Kuiper belt beyond the orbit of Neptune. It has an orbit around the Sun with an approximate periodicity of 76 years, so it is said that the comet is seen only once in a lifetime; but, what would happen if it passed closer to the Earth? In the simulation we will make tests to present the results of this hypothesis with distance such as the moon and mars.

> -In this project we will make the simulation of Halley's comet passing near the Earth over a month.

## Methodology
We follow the next points to resolve this problem:
1. Understanding the problem
 > Halley's comet has a trajectory that allows it to pass close to Earth every 76 years. The conditions of distance to the Earth, its weight and speed allow its orbit to be in equilibrium.  
2. Formulate hypotheses
¿Qué pasaría si por una perturbación 
>What would happen if a disturbance in Halley's orbit caused it to come closer to Earth during its path?
Our hypothesis is that it will be attracted by the Earth's attractive field.
3. Define the type of model to be used
> We will simulate an n-body system with Halley and the Earth as particles on which gravitational attraction forces act.

4. Define initial conditions
5. Perform modeling
6. Analyze results
7. Converge the model to a good modeling result.
## Initial variables:
* Earth: 
  * Position: [0, 0, 0]
  * Mass: 6 x 10^24 kg
  * Orbital speed: [30000,0,0] 30 km/sec
* Halley's Comet:
  * Position: [0,5e9,0]
  * Mass: 2.2×10^14 kg
  * Orbital speed: [54500,0,0] 54.5 km/sec 
## Requirements:
* Python3 : `sudo apt-get install python3.8` 
* Matplotlib: `pip3 install mathplotlib`
* mpl_toolkits.mplot3d: `pip3 install mpl_toolkits`
## Installation:
- Clone the repository:
  > git clone https://github.com/M999X/Halley-modelling.git 
## Run:
Go to the folder of the project and and type on a console  `python3 normal_distance.py` to run the normal distance,`python3 mars_distance.py` for mars distance and `python3 moon_distance.py` for the moon, the program will be executed, and you will get a chart with the halley's trajectory.
## Results:
* Simulation 1: Our first result show us that halley's comet pass far away of earth 5,097,768,243 kilometers to be precise, so do not affect the earth's orbit, in our chart we can watch neither the earth and halley's affects each other orbit, that's our expected results

* Simulation 2: We simulated the halley's comet with mars distance to earth 54.6 million kilometers , we can watch halley's comet create a kind of orbit with earth, we simulated with 7 months and halleys will crash into the earth, maybe if we add more particles to our model the comet will be atracted to other body.<br>

* Simulation 3: We simulated the halley's comet with moon distance to earth 384,400 km , this chart show us a devastating news, if  halley's comet passes at the same distance that moon, will collide to earth causing the destruction of humanity.

## Conclusion:
Our results show comet pass far away from earth and do not affect earth.The comet's closest approach to Earth occurred in 837, at a distance of 0.033 AU (3.07 million miles or 4.94 million kilometers). But, what would happen if pass closer to earth ?.
If it passes at the same distance as Mars, Halley's comet creates a kind of orbit and the comet has more velocity than earth.
If it passes at the same distance as the moon, Halley's comet will collide with earth. 
Thanks to the universe for putting Halley's comet far away from the earth.
